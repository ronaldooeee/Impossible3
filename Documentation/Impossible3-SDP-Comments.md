1. Very nice job on this!
2. You're the first ones to include a link to the projplan description page...
3. NIT: Try to get the numbered headers to "keep with next" so they are on the same page as the following text (widow/orphan control?)
4. You need a bit more detail in the hardware and software resources tables.  What kind of graphics card is required, with how much GRAM?  Why do you require SSE2 support for execution but not for development?  Are you not going to test your code during development?
5. You specify a GPU under PC in the *software* table... the GPU is a hardware device

Fix these few things and you'll have full credit.
